Learning Reflection
Diving into QA concepts gave me a whole new appreciation for the role of quality assurance in building great software. I picked up skills like planning and designing test cases, along with running them effectively. I also learned when manual testing works best and when automation is the way to go. Exploring methodologies like Agile helped me see how QA fits into different workflows, and it’s been great to understand how these methods ensure the software isn’t just functional but meets higher standards overall.

Getting into Selenium has been a game-changer for understanding test automation. I learned how to work with web elements, simulate user actions, and check that things work the way they’re supposed to, all without manual effort. Writing test scripts taught me how to handle tricky things like finding the right locators, dealing with dynamic elements, creating tests that don’t break easily and figured out how to debug my scripts when things didn’t go as planned. Overall, it’s been super satisfying to see tests run smoothly!
